I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) (CUHK), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/). 
Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) (UMass) and the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/), as well as Prof. [Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/) at MIT. 
Prior to this, I was also honored to be advised by Prof. [Chi-Wing Fu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/) at CUHK. 

My research experience covers various aspects of deep learning. Under the supervision of Prof. Chi-Wing Fu, I focused on low-level vision, self-supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning on shadow detection task.  With Prof. Chuang Gan, I expanded my work to include audio processing, autoencoders, generative models (e.g., diffusion model) and large language models. My most recent research with Prof. Chuang Gan and Yilun Du involves building a lifelong memory system for embodied agents to perform embodied question-answering and lifelong navigation tasks. 

My current research interests lie in embodied AI and multimodal learning.  My recent work on embodied AI has made me realize both the limitations and great potential of current AI agents with physical bodies that can interact with the environment. Although large language models have already surpassed most humans in language capabilities and world knowledges, AI agents that operate like living creatures are still far from mature. I hold a plain belief that, since our advancements in AI, such as large language models, have overcome the complexities of language--the most intricate invention of all living beings--an AI agent capable of perceiving and interacting with the multimodal environment will ultimately be achieved in the comming years, by us.

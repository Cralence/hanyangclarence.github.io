I am a third-year undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) (CUHK), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/). 
Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) at the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/). 
Prior to this, I was also honored to be advised by Prof. [Chi-Wing Fu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/) at CUHK. 

My research interests lie in the multi-modality learning across vision, language and audio. 
Throughout my research experience, I have gained a wide range of knowledge in various aspects of deep learning. 
Under the supervision of Prof. Chi-Wing Fu, I focused on low-level vision, self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning area.
With Prof. Chuang Gan, I have further expanded my work to include audio processing, autoencoders, generative models (e.g., diffusion model) 
and large language models.
